## The most important thing in my career has been my community.

^ some call it my network, some call it my resources, some call it mentors
^ I would not be where I am today if it weren't for my community.

## No matter the field, if one doesn't have a **community** around them, they will **not** stay in said field.

# The 3 Pillars

---

# The 3 Pillars
- Advocacy
- Accelerating
- Advising

---

# Advocacy

---

## **Publicly** recommending and supporting each other!

^ The most common example: a Code of Conduct
^ Everyone should know what you and your community stand for.
^ Positive feedback in public for people to see, constructive feedback in a setting where folks are more comfortable.

---

# Accelerate

---

## Bettering each other!

^Through friendship, scholarship, sponsorship, mentorship, calling each other out

---

# Advise

---

## Mentorship!

^ Fostering a mentorship culture is all about giving back
^ Lift as you climb

---

## The best way to combine these things together is to **teach your community.**

^ Teaching is something that involves mentorship to improve each other and support learning in your community.

---

# **Teaching works!**

^ Teaching is not only a great tool to help build your community, but to also build your own skills.
^ Studies consistently say that when you teach others, you retain information better.
^ I am an example of this! (Learning community in college, HTML + CSS class first year out of school, HTML + CSS workshops, React course online, React workshops, advanced React online classes, also presenting at conferences.

---

## Teaching can be intimidating, but it doesn't have to be.

^ Sometimes teaching isn't a formal setting, sometimes it's just briefly explaining something small!
^ Blogging, short tips and tutorials, answering questions on SO, even short videos can be your medium.

---

## Repetition is recognition!

^ Questions people ask can help you refine what you teach. Stumbling blocks you have can save you the next time you teach.

---

# Actively teach your community.

^ Knowledge that only gets deeper through repetition, refinement, and discussion.
^ A community of people willing to teach each other, without ego, is healthy, inclusive, and beneficial to everyone.
