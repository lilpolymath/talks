# On being funny

---

Hello

---

Apparently I'm hilarious and you people want to learn how.

---

Good news, you can.

---

## Here's my strats for humor in general, and telling jokes for tech people.

---

### Every single moment in life is an opportunity

## Every single moment in life is an opportunity
* For a pun

## Every single moment in life is an opportunity
* For a pun
* For a rhyme 
* For a one-liner

---

Your puns and rhymes and one-liners don't have to be good.

---

Your puns and rhymes and one-liners don't have to make sense.

---

**They have to be executed consistently.**

---

## Repetition is recognition

---

When people start to get used to your PROs, they start expecting them.

---

When they start expecting them, they feel "in" on the joke.

---

When they feel "in" on the joke, they both feel included AND think you're extra funny because they "got it".

---

People love feeling like they are in on an inside joke, even if it isn't one.

---

Repeating something -> Recognition of the joke -> Reliable laughs

---

## Examples in Cassidy's crap
* "Pi time"
* "It's done"
* "Ah ha ha ha, that's so funny"
* "I'm going to needlepoint that on a pillow"
* "Like my butt"
* "That was my nickname in high school"

---

## Writing humor

---

### Write down EVERYTHING.

---

Humor comes at unexpected times in unexpected places.

---

Sometimes a joke might sit for years.

---

When its moment comes, it will be beautiful.

---

## Examples of partial jokes that Cassidy has written down but hasn't actually told
- A robber shoots through a fish store and says, "holey mackerel" before he leaves
- A guy named Gus who is fun is fungus
- Sponsors spawn sores
- Wildebeest that is bewildered is a bewildebeest
- Make Tests Not Testes: SDETS Against Birthing Males

* The rule of three

^ This kind of combines all of the above, where you establish a narrative with two concepts, and a twist with a third at the end. For example: "can I help you work anything? The CSS, that JavaScript, your bad attitude?"
