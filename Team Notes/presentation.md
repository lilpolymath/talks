## I **love** taking notes!

^ Our brains are pretty disorganized, and writing is the solution for that. Plenty of studies have shown that if you want to learn and remember something long term, you need to write it down. If you want to understand ideas, you have to translate them into your own words.
^ Beyond ourselves though, thinking about teams...

---

## Taking notes is important.

^ Writing down meeting minutes, notes from conversations with teammates, or even ideas that you want to propose is essential for remembering what happens throughout your day.

---

## Finding notes is **just as** important.

^ You can rarely, if ever, remember exactly what you were thinking or the exact words or phrases you were using when you originally wrote down yours or your teammates' ideas. We lose that essential context too quickly.

---

## Collective knowledge is reliant on both creation and retrieval.

^ If you want your team to have a shared context and vocabulary, there needs to be buy-in on taking notes.
^ Thinking about making your notes "searchable" though can bog you down as you're writing everything. You want to stay productive because ideas are fleeting, but powerful if they're captured well!
^ The morbid term "bus factor": would the project be in jeopardy if someone were hit by a bus? I don't like this term, but it's an important thing to consider. The risk of not writing things down in a searchable way means that the knowledge could go away. You don't want your teammates to not be able to take a peaceful vacation, or work on something new, or leave the team in a bad place if they leave entirely.

## You need a **predictable system** for your notes!

---

> Standardization enables creativity.
-- Sönke Ahrens

^ If you don't have a predictable, easy-to-navigate system for your notes, then whenever you want to apply your team's decisions or ideas, you'll end up spending unnecessary energy just trying to find what you need.
^ When you have common formatting, organization, and a shared understanding of how to document things allows your team to think, discuss, reflect, hypothesize, test, and share more together. This is the creative work that matters!

---

## There's no **perfect** system.

^ The way your team takes notes is up to you. Tools don't matter, systems don't matter.
^ As long as your team has shared buy-in and everyone uses the same approach, that's what matters!
^ Build templates that people can pull from, have "scratch pad" spots where you can jot down quick ideas and format/organize later, and don't treat notes as if they're permanently etched in stone.
^ You don't want to become data hoarders necessarily (regularly auditing notes and documents as being out of date/archivable is a good thing), but having the context available to anyone who might need it will pay dividends over time.
